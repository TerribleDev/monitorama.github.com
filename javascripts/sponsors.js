Visualization of Grok's analysis is displayed on a constantly updated mobile device, enabling IT professionals to assess the health of their systems anytime, anywhere.</p><p>The algorithms that power Grok are based on principles discovered in studying how the brain processes information. This biologically inspired machine intelligence technology was first described in Jeff Hawkins' book &quot;On Intelligence&quot;.  This technology is ideal for large-scale analysis of continuously streaming datasets and excels at modeling and predicting patterns in data.  Grok and the machine intelligence algorithms that Grok leverages were developed by Numenta, Inc.</p>"
