        <h2>An Open Source Monitoring Conference &amp; Hackathon</h2>

        <section class="welcome">
          <h4>Join us in Boston.</h4>
          <p>We'll be hearing talks from leading open source developers and web operations luminaries, and then taking what we've learned to apply it towards advancing the state of open source monitoring and trending software.</p>

          <h4>Why me?</h4>
          <p>Because you care about the tools that you work with. You're a craftsman within your team and want to help improve the work environment for you and your peers. We've all heard that monitoring sucks, but you want to do something about it.</p>

          <h4>Boston in March?</h4>
          <p>You better believe it. The end of March is already in Spring and the weather is starting to warm up. Bring a light jacket and prepare to kick ass.</p>

          <h4>I'm convinced. What now?</h4>
          <p>Grab your ticket as soon as soon as registration opens. Be forewarned, space is limited and interest is surging.</p>

        <section class="speakers">
          <h4>Meet the Speakers.</h4>

        </section>

        <section class="schedule">
          <h4>Not Your Average Single-Track.</h4>
          <p>Rise and shine for single-track sessions in the morning that will enlighten and inspire you for the afternoon activities. After lunch we'll break out into workshops to level up your craftsman tools (e.g. Logstash filters, D3.js, etc), or jump right into the hackathon and pair up with a friend or hack on your own.

            <p>The Microsoft New England Research &amp; Development Center (NERD) is a research and software innovation campus located in the heart of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The NERD vertical campus spans two buildings with its primary presence and conference center located at One Memorial Drive and a recently renovated and expanded space located at One Cambridge Center. NERD is home to some of Microsoft’s most strategic teams including Microsoft Research New England, Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V), SharePoint Workspace, Microsoft Technical Computing, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft Lync, Microsoft Office 365 and more. NERD has become a hub of activity for the local tech community and has hosted more than 900 events and welcomed more than 80,000 visitors during the past three years.</p>

            <img src="./images/github_logo.png" />
            <p>GitHub provides tools to collaboratively develop and host source code. Code review, issue tracking, wikis with ReST, AsciiDoc, and Markdown support -- our goal is to make it easier for you and your team to build great software, whether your team is your co-workers sitting next to you or strangers across the globe. Open source can use GitHub completely for free, making it a great place to discover interesting projects, while businesses can feel safe with our secure private offerings.</p>

            <img src="./images/boundary_logo.png" width="200" />
            <p>Boundary’s vision is to drive the next wave of distributed applications by making it easy to monitor and maintain applications in highly dynamic IT environments.  Cloud-based architectures, modern application components, and customer demand for continuous quality of service require a much faster, easier and more relevant way to monitor applications.</p>

          <p>We are enormously grateful to Microsoft for graciously offering the use of their NERD facility for the Monitorama event, without which this conference and hackathon would not be possible.</p>
