            <h4>Join us in Portland!</h4>

            <p>We'll be hearing talks from leading open source developers and web operations luminaries, and then taking what we've learned to apply it towards advancing the state of open source monitoring and trending software.</p>

            <h4>Why me?</h4>

            <p>Because you care about the tools that you work with. You're an artisan within your team and want to help improve the work environment for you and your peers. We've all heard that monitoring sucks, but you want to do something about it.</p>

            <h4>Portland in May?</h4>

            <p>Definitely. Portland in May is beautiful as the weather warms up and the rain tapers off. Bring a light jacket and prepare to have a great time.</p>

            <h4>I'm convinced. What now?</h4>

            <p class="text-center">Go <a href="http://www.monitorama.com/#registration">get your ticket</a> while they last!</p>

            <h4>Not Your Average Single-Track.</h4>

            <p>Monitorama takes place May 5-7, 2014 in the Gerding Theater at The Armory in Portland, Oregon. Monday is dedicated to keynotes and sessions intended to get you thinking outside the box. Tuesday we focus on real-world monitoring applications and patterns in more single-track sessions and workshops. On Wednesday, all bets are off. Plan for hacking, fun, and wherever our imagination (and feet) take us. We might even move outdoors, so dress accordingly!</p>

            <p>We'll announce the final schedule after the CFP has closed.</p>

              <p><strong>Preparation is key.</strong> Have an idea what you want to work on. Know your tools beforehand so you can dive right in.</p>
              <p><strong>Be flexible.</strong> You might want to go it alone, or decide you want to join a team. Or multiple teams. Or work on multiple tasks by yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>Adjust your scope.</strong> Understand that you're working within the constraints of a typical workday. We're not going to fix the entire Monitoring toolchain in a single day.</p>
              <p><strong>There will be distractions.</strong> You're going to be surrounded by a couple hundred like-minded people who want to share their experiences and wisdom (or ask for yours). Bring headphones if you want some &quot;quiet time&quot;.</p>
              <p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Enjoy the workshops (but not too many). Be inquisitive but focused.</p>
              <p><strong>Enjoy the limelight.</strong> We might ask you to present your work(s) in a 5-minute demo. Embrace the opportunity to share your passion with others. We <span class="heart">❤</span> you and want you to succeed.</p>
              <p><strong>Have fun.</strong> Leave your prejudices at the door. Meet new people and have a great time. We're holding this event to help make things better. You're a part of that now and no one can ever take that away from you.</p>

                <p>InfluxDB is an open source, distributed time series, metrics, and events database. It's designed for analytics workloads for operations, application, user, and business analytics. Written in Go, InfluxDB has no external dependencies. That means you can get running without managing a Zookeeper, HBase, or Cassandra deployment. With a SQL-like query language and an HTTP API, InfluxDB is useful even if you're running only a single box. However, it's built to scale out to hundreds of machines as your data expands. With a growing community, libraries in many languages, plugins for StatsD, CollectD, Fluent, Sensu and others, InfluxDB is the central data store for all your metrics, events, and analytics. We offer support, professional services, and managed hosting to get you up and running either in your own environment or in the cloud.</p>

            <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>

            <p>All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any Monitorama event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

            <h5>The Quick Version</h5>

            <p>Monitorama is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

            <h5>The Less Quick Version</h5>

            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

            <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.</p>

            <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Monitorama.</p>

            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be visible by their special badges and clothing.</p>

            <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

            <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>
